    "***Flask*** is a [microframework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/foreword/#what-does-micro-mean) for web development with Python. It can be used for full-stack web applications, but it's also very popular for deploying machine learning models as APIs. In fact, the Google Cloud function Python tooling that is used in the curriculum lesson linked above uses Flask \"under the hood\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is that same cloud function, rewritten as a Flask app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def iris_prediction(sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width):\n",
    "    with open(\"model.pkl\", \"rb\") as f:\n",
    "        model = joblib.load(f)\n",
    "    X = [[sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width]]\n",
    "    predictions = model.predict(X)\n",
    "    prediction = int(predictions[0])\n",
    "    return {\"predicted_class\": prediction}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, world!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    request_json = request.get_json()\n",
    "    result = iris_prediction(**request_json)\n",
    "    return json.dumps(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's definitely a bit longer than the cloud function version, but it has two benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can actually run the server on your local computer, which makes **debugging** much faster and easier.\n",
    "2. Rather than using Google Cloud functions (a paid service, although there are free credits when you sign up), you can use **Heroku** to deploy your API, which is **100% free** for up to 5 apps. (You can also deploy using an EC2 instance or other cloud container if your model is too large/slow for Heroku.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Besides Heroku and AWS EC2, you can also host flask apps with [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-a-web-app-with-azure-app-service/index), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps), [Google Cloud App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/python/getting-started/hello-world), and [AWS Elatic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html)."
